# PyTomation #

> **Under development, alpha preview**. New versions may (and probably) break old implementations.

An advanced, fully hackable automation library written in Python

## Why???

With existing tools like Make, Just, Task, etc., it's difficult to create a complex automation script with many steps
and logic statements. Often, it is easier to write a small script that can later be called by the specific tool.

PyTomatic isn't a build tool; instead, it is a library that helps transform your static project into a dynamic one.

And, of course, it's built with non-Python projects in mind.

## Installation

> TBD

### None-Python project

Easy; Install python (up to 3.10) and create a project, after, follow the next step. It should always be installed in a
virtual environment!

### Python project

Just add in your dependency descriptor:

```text
pytomation
```
